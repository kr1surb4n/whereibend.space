		<p>So how am I share something I wrote with people, blog post or code, if I always think that
what I made is bad or wrong or I think is not finished? I will not.
If I will continue this, I won't publish nothing. No one will see what I did. My thinking will be
for nothing. It will be just useless waste of time/air/money. </p>
<p>So how am I going to know when it's ready? I won't. I will never know. It's not my job. I will share
with people what I want to share. I will constantly update what I did. When I realize that something
is wrong I will have to fix it. This is so easy. I will make thousands mistakes, many more than I did
to this moment.</p>
<p>I always was ashamed of what I did. Although everything what I did worked as it had to. I didn't wanted
to look back at what I did. Never. I always thought that what I did was shit, that I  was useless.
I was surrounded by people that constantly said I'm useless, that I'm not good enough.
Usually those people where first to say how useless I was, what mistakes I did, but I never saw them doing anything
the way they wanted me to do. When I look back and see from what dark hole I crawled from, I stop being afraid and scared.
I stop being afraid of people.</p>
<p>Thank god I've done backups of my work. When I gathered it all I saw how much I've done I didn't believe it. I thought that
I haven't done much, but it's not true. Removing those thoughts wasn't easy or fast. They still like to come back, but I can
recognize them so quickly that they won't have time to attach to myself. </p>
<p>I will do things the way I like. I won't hide it and most important I won't hide myself.
I might look like a tornado of things but this is me.</p>
